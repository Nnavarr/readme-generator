## Readme Generator

## Description
The repository contains the code base for the readme generator app; a node application that utilizes inquirer to dynamically generate a readme file. 

## Usage
To use the node app, simply download the "Develop" folder's contents to your local machine. From there, ensure that the required node modules are also installed. Once complete and with the command line cd into the "Develop" root directory, simply run "node index.js". This will kick off the inquirer prompts that will be used to create the README.md file within the 'dist' directory.

The file can then be saved into a new/existing project directory to be used as the README.
